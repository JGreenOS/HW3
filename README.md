# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator


## Description
This exercise was to create a password generator with user defined input between 8 and 128 characters with at least 1 set selected from the following: lowercase English alphabet, uppercase English alphabet, numerals 0-9 and selected symbols.

Features of password generator:  In this exercise, I used two methods to generate the characters.  The String.fromCharCode was used to reference the ASCII character table to build the arrays for the character sets. This was relatively easy.  The second method involved concatenating the arrays based on user input, to create a derived set of characters to be randomized in the password creation.

I had to get the assistance of a TA to help me define the objects and the nested function in the generate password function.
